# enable_disable_soundcard_windows
enable_disable_soundcard_windows

These two Python scripts interact with the system's audio settings using the pycaw library. Here's what each script does:

Script 1: Muting System Volume and Disabling Sound Card
mute_system_volume(): This function mutes the system volume by iterating through all audio sessions using AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions() and muting each session.
disable_sound_card(): This function tries to disable the sound card using ctypes.windll.winmm.waveOutSetVolume(None, 0). It sets the sound card volume to zero, effectively muting it. If an error occurs during this process, it prints the error message.


Script 2: Enabling Sound Card
enable_sound_card(): This function is responsible for enabling the sound card. It first checks if there are any active audio sessions. If there are none, it prints a message and returns. If there are active sessions, it iterates through them and attempts to unmute each session and set its volume to the maximum using volume.SetMute(0, None) and volume.SetMasterVolume(1.0, None) respectively.
In summary, the first script mutes the system volume and disables the sound card, while the second script enables the sound card and sets the volume to maximum for all active audio sessions. These scripts provide basic control over audio settings programmatically.
